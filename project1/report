I started this project by creating the StudentGrade struct to hold the students'
information, such as their name, the score they received after comparison, the letter
grade based on the score, and a boolean value indicating whether or not the student's
code could be compiled. After creating the struct, I wrote out the names and parameters
for the methods I would use: submissionProcessor(), getLetterGrade(), getScore(), and
printGrades(). Since we are only looking at 4 student submissions and the scores are out of
100, I created two constant variables, OUT_OF and NUM_STUDENTS, to hold those values.

submissionProcessor() takes in the struct array and set number of students we are grading as
parameters. I used a for loop to create the student struct array that saved the student name,
used the student name to build the filename to use for the getScore() function, called the
getScore() function to get the student's final score, check if the source code if compilable, and
called getLetterGrade to get the student's letter grade. While I mostly used the lecture slides
and looked at my previous assignments for guidance regarding the structs, I looked to the internet
for ways to build the filename and student name, and how to actually check if a C file can compile
using system(). After checking if the file is compilable, I set the compiled variable to true or
false. If the source code does not compile, I automatically give the student a 0.

getLetterGrade() was the second function I made where I took in the student array. First, I checked
the compiled variable, and, if it was false, I automatically set the student's grade to an F. If
the student's code could compile, I continued to the next if and else-if statements to set the
student's letter grade to a specific letter based on the given score.

getScore() was the first function I created, and it takes the filename of the current student struct
to begin comapring the student's source code to the answer.c file. I opened the answer code and
student's file, then used a while loop to compare each line. If a line from the student's submission
was different from the answer code, I deducted a point from the score variable. After iterating
through the files, I returned the final score to submissionProcessor() to save to the student's
score and closed both files.

printGrades() was a bit more difficult, but I ultimately used a for loop to sort the student array
and print the sorted grades. For this one, I looked up different sorting algorithms and found used
something to selection sort to arrange the array to where the student with the highest score was
put moved to the front of the array until the array was sorted bt highest to lowest. After sorting,
I used another for loop to iterate through the sorted student array and print each grade.

In the main method, I created the student struct array, and called submissionProcessor() and
printGrades() with the student array and NUM_STUDENTS as their arguments.

For the Makefile, I basically looked to the makefile I made for Assignment 2 and created one in my
Project 1 folder. The makefile compiles the main.c code and cleans the source code and temporary
executable file from the system() I used in submissionProcessor().
