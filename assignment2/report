1.) How did you implement DetermineNetwork()?
    For DetermineNetwork(), I created two variables, best_signal and
    best_network, to compare the signal strengths of each cached
    network and save the name of the network with the strongest signal.
    I wrote three conditional statements to compare the medium to the 
    criteria, and each iterates through the cached networks matches the
    criteria of the medium. 
    
    If I'm looking at wifi connection, it confirms the network is
    actually a wifi connection and if there's a password saved, then
    the signal strengths are compared to each other until the 
    strongest network's name is saved and returned to the
    ChooseNetwork() function.

2.) How did you implement ScanNetworksV3()?
    For ScanNetworksV3(), I have a variable to temporarily hold the
    password_saved boolean, the number indicating the medium, and an
    iterator variable for the while loop. I also declared a file pointer
    and opened the experiment_data file in reading mode, and did
    some file error handling.

    The while loop iterates through the experiment_data file, scanning
    network name, connection medium, signal strength, and if there's a
    password saved in one line. If there's a password saved, the scanned
    values are saved as a cached network struct. After the function is
    done iterating, the experiment_data file is closed.
